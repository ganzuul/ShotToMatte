# Scene Detection Queue Integration Plan

## Overview
Integration of scene detection with our enhanced queue system requires careful handling of scene boundaries, confidence thresholds, and error cases. This document outlines the strategy for combining these components while maintaining robust error handling and performance monitoring.

## Scene-Specific Drop Reasons

### Detection Queue
- `scene_feature_extraction_failed`: Features couldn't be extracted from frame
- `scene_confidence_too_low`: Scene detection confidence below threshold
- `scene_boundary_uncertain`: Ambiguous scene boundary detection
- `detection_queue_full`: Queue capacity reached (existing)

### Flow Queue
- `scene_mismatch`: Frame doesn't match current scene context
- `flow_confidence_low`: Optical flow confidence below threshold
- `scene_transition_boundary`: Frame marks end/start of scene
- `flow_queue_full`: Queue capacity reached (existing)

### Stitch Queue
- `scene_context_missing`: Required scene context not available
- `stitch_alignment_failed`: Cannot align frame with scene
- `scene_boundary_reached`: Natural scene boundary
- `stitch_queue_full`: Queue capacity reached (existing)

## Scene Detection Integration

### 1. WorkUnit Enhancement
```python
class WorkUnit:
    scene_info = {
        'scene_id': int,
        'confidence': float,
        'features': dict,
        'boundary_type': Optional[str],  # 'start', 'end', 'middle'
        'temporal_context': {
            'prev_scene_id': Optional[int],
            'next_scene_id': Optional[int],
            'frame_position': float  # 0.0 to 1.0 in scene
        }
    }
```

### 2. Queue Processing Stages

#### Detection Stage
1. Extract scene features
2. Update scene context
3. Check confidence thresholds
4. Mark scene boundaries
5. Decision making:
   - Promote to flow if part of current scene
   - Hold if scene boundary uncertain
   - Drop if confidence too low

#### Flow Stage
1. Validate scene context
2. Compute optical flow
3. Update scene boundary information
4. Decision making:
   - Promote to stitch if flow confirms scene
   - Hold for additional context
   - Drop if scene mismatch detected

#### Stitch Stage
1. Verify scene alignment
2. Check boundary conditions
3. Process panorama updates
4. Decision making:
   - Process if scene context complete
   - Hold for missing context
   - Drop if alignment fails

## Error Handling Strategy

### 1. Scene Detection Errors
- Handle feature extraction failures
- Manage confidence threshold violations
- Track scene boundary uncertainties

### 2. Context Management Errors
- Handle missing scene context
- Manage temporal discontinuities
- Track scene transition failures

### 3. Processing Pipeline Errors
- Monitor queue state transitions
- Track processing failures
- Handle resource constraints
